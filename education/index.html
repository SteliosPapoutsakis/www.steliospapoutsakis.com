				<h5>Finite State Machine Verilog Code Generation (Undergraduate Research)</h5> 
				<p>I developed a Java program which through automation translated a custom high level behavioral description of an Extended Finite State Machine (FSMD) into a Verilog RTL model. The custom grammer was parsed and interpreted using <a href="https://www.antlr.org/">Antlr</a>. The tool supports basic arithmetic (+,-,*,/,&) of registrar values at each state, as well as branching conditionals. The tool elegantly separates the computational unit and the design controller into separate verilog modules. Additionally, I also developed a GUI using JavaFX that allows users to easily describe their FSMD.</p>

				<h5>Sign Language Glove Translator (Senoir Capstone)</h5> 
				<p>My capstone group developed a wearable glove that would classify gestures as English letters, as described in the American Sign Language (ASL). This device used <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1070?gclid=CjwKCAjw64eJBhAGEiwABr9o2KrOtVBuX6zTZEcNOUrY8h18PkUYsNDzV7e2EFoVzkgrql25vqFxSBoCWksQAvD_BwE">flex sensors</a>, which changed their resistive value based on how much they are flexed, in combination with an accelerometer. We used an <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-with-headers">Arduino Nano 33 BLE</a> which would process data from the sensors. A Machine learning Neural Network "one vs rest" classifier was developed with Tensorflow and converted into a C header file using TinyML. This header file allowed us to run the model on the glove, which would continuously run and classify gestures .

				<h5>Orientation Assistant Cordinator, Leader</h5> 
				<p> I co-led a training program for freshman orientation leaders and assistants. I planned lessons, created leader/assistant pairs, presented to trainees, led group activities and assisted during orientation week. Overall I helped train a group of about 85 leaders/assistants. The leaders/assistant then went on to teach the first year course at University of Portland and run orientation events during move in week.</p>

				<h5>School Senator</h5> 
				<p>
I represented the school of engineering at the University of Portland in student government. My main initiative was to improve student athletics for UP students. I worked towards this goal by attending weekly meetings, holding office hours and reaching out to campus officials. My proudest moment was co-founding the free swim program, which allowed students to swim for free at a local community pool. This program was necessary because our only swimming pool on campus had been removed months prior. The program was consistently used by 200-300 students monthly, and eventually led to an increased budget for the program.</p>

				<h5>Physics Peer Leader</h5> 
				<p>I taught two intro to physics lab courses. The labs that I taught were Physics I (kinematics) and Physics II (electricity and magnetism). My responsibilities included teaching a three hours weekly lab, helping students problem solve, grading homework assignments and occasionally would lecture material not covered in the main course. I also would tutor students twice a week.

				<h5>Computer Science Lab TA and Grader</h5> 
				<p>I was a TA in an intro to Unix systems lab. I problem solved with students to understand and fix errors. I kept track of student progression throughout the lab. I also graded homework for a CS intro level course. I debugged code and provided valuable feedback to help students in the course.</p>
