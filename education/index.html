				<h5>F2VGen (Finite State Machine Verilog Code Generator), Undergraduate Research</h5> 
				<p>I developed a Java program which through automation translated a custom high level behavioral description of an Extended Finite State Machine (FSMD) into a Verilog RTL model. The custom grammer was parsed and interpreted using <a href="https://www.antlr.org/">Antlr</a>. The tool supports basic arithmetic (+,-,*,/,&) of registrar values at each state, as well as branching conditionals. The tool elegantly separates the computational unit and the design controller into separate verilog modules. Additionally, I also developed a GUI using JavaFX that allows users to easily describe their FSMD. This added additional features, such as load/saving a design, realtime FSMD drawing and error checking.</p>

				<h5>Sign Language Glove Translator (Senoir Capstone)</h5> 
				<p>My capstone group developed a wearable glove that would classify gestures as English letters, as described in the American Sign Language (ASL). This device used <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1070?gclid=CjwKCAjw64eJBhAGEiwABr9o2KrOtVBuX6zTZEcNOUrY8h18PkUYsNDzV7e2EFoVzkgrql25vqFxSBoCWksQAvD_BwE">flex sensors</a>, which changed their resistive value based on how much they are flexed, in combination with an accelerometer. We used an <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-with-headers">Arduino Nano 33 BLE</a> which would process data from the sensors. A Machine learning Neural Network "one vs rest" classifier was developed with Tensorflow and converted into a C header file using tinyML. This header file allowed us to run the model on the glove, which would continuously run and classify gestures .

				<h5>Orientation Assistant Cordinator, Leader</h5> 
				<p> I co-led a training program for freshman orientation leaders and assistants. This training program was designed to help current student leaders run orientation activities for new students and teach the first year workshop course. I planned lessons, created leader/assistant pairs, presented to trainees, led group activities and assisted during orientation week. Overall, I helped train a group of about 85 leaders/assistants. The leaders/assistant then went on to teach the first year course at University of Portland and run orientation events during move in week.</p>

				<h5>Shiley School of Engineering Senator</h5> 
				<p>
I represented the school of engineering at the University of Portland student government. My main initiative was to improve student athletics for UP students. I worked towards this goal by attending weekly meetings, holding office hours and reaching out to campus officials. My one proudest moment was co-founding the free swim program, which allowed students to swim for free at a local community pool. This program was necessary because our only swimming pool on campus had been removed months prior. The program was consistently used by 200-300 students monthly, and eventually led to an increased budget for the program. Another moment was when I advocated for a university food bank, which would supply students experiencing food insecurity. This eventually led to a proposed Pilot Care initiative, which would provide university meal points and assistance to such students </p>

				<h5>Physics Peer Leader</h5> 
				<p>I taught two intro to physics lab courses. These labs were Physics I (kinematics) and Physics II (electricity and magnetism). My responsibilities included teaching a three hours weekly lab, helping students problem solve, grading homework assignments and lecture on material not covered in the main course. I also would tutor students twice a week.

				<h5>Computer Science Lab TA and Grader</h5> 
				<p>I was a TA for a intro to Unix systems lab. I problem solved with students to help them understand and fix errors. I kept track of student progression throughout the lab. I also graded homework for a CS intro level course. I debugged code and provided feedback to aid students' programing skill and style.</p>
