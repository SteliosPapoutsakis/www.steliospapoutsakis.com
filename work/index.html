				<h5>ELK Stack Montioring Solution</h5>
				<p class="text"> I used data analysis tools such as Python, Pandas, R, Spark and Nifi to help maintian the ingetstion of NAND Storage relibailty data into Apache Hadoop. I created a automatedd metic collection system from this pipeline that retrives data and indexes into a ELasticsearch cluster. I then configured a visualiation tool called Kibana, which allowed for a "visual dashboard". This dashboard included graphes and relevant information that is used to monitor the health of the ingestion process.

				<h5>PySpark Framework</h5>
				<p class="text"> I wrote a Python wrapper around a existing in house Scala Spark framework. This allowed my group, which worked in python, to easily use the framework with a familiar API  </p>

				<h5>Graph Analysis</h5>
				<p class="text"> I used the Python libary networkx to visualize step tranistions in the fabrication process. I then further explored using PySpark MLib to make predictions about the fabrication process.</p>

			<h5> Miscellaneous tasks </h5>
			<p class="text"> I also updated Python CGI, PHP and javascript web tools for internal sites.

	<h3>Quality Engineer Intership</h3>
	<h4>Achievements</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<div>
				<h5>Report Generation Tool</h5>
				<p class="text"> I translated a report generation script from Perl to Python. The script analyized tens of log file that were created from running a tool for Calibre. I replaced command line interface with a web application, allowing for reports to be dynamically generated with the newest data. I Implemented caching system for faster generation of reports and engineered customization options allowing for groups to parse for different data. I also refactored the code base to included new economical changes and leverage Python's multiprocessing functionailty to improve the report generation time by a factor of 3.</p>

				<h5>Testing suite for Secure Enviroments</h5>
				<p class="text"> In order for Calibre to be tested with the latest desgins, testing is now being done in secure chambre enviroments. These enviroments ensure that the company's IP is protect. I was tasked to research an all in one testing solution that would allow Quallity assurance engineers to easily test desgins between different enviroments. I researched current in house tools and created a TCL Tinker GUI interface that was similar to the current in house offering at Mentor.
