				<h5>ELK Stack Montioring Solution</h5>
				<p class="text">
I used data analysis tools such as Python, Pandas, R, Spark and Nifi to help monitor the ingestion of NAND Storage reliability data into Apache Hadoop. I created an automated system from this pipeline that retrieves data and indexes it into an Elasticsearch cluster. I then configured a visualization tool called Kibana, which allowed for a "visual dashboard". I created a  dashboard with graphics and relevant information that is used to monitor the health of the ingestion process.

				<h5>PySpark Framework</h5>
				<p class="text"> I wrote a Python wrapper around a existing in house Scala Spark framework. This allowed my group, which worked in python, to easily use the framework with a familiar API  </p>

			<div>
				<h5>Graph Analysis</h5>
				<p class="text">I used the Python library, networkx, to visualize step transitions in the NAND fabrication process. I then explored using PySpark MLib to make predictions about the fabrication process.</p>

			<h5> Miscellaneous tasks </h5>
			<p class="text"> I also updated Python CGI, PHP and javascript web tools for internal sites.

	<h3>Quality Engineer Intership</h3>
	<h4>Achievements</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<div>
				<h5>Report Generation Tool</h5>
				<p class="text">I translated a report generation script from Perl to Python. The script analyzed several log files that were created from running a tool for Calibre. I replaced the command line interface with a web application, which allowed for reports to be dynamically generated with the newest data. I Implemented a caching system for faster generation of reports. In addition I engineered customization options allowing for groups to parse for different data and change the data present in the report. I also refactored the code base to include new economical changes and leverage Python's multiprocessing functionality to improve the report generation time by a factor of 3.</p>

				<h5>Testing suite for Secure Enviroments</h5>
				<p class="text">In order for Calibre to be tested with the latest designs, testing needed to be done in secure chamber environments. These environments ensure that the company's IP is protected. I was tasked to research an all in one testing solution that would allow the quality assurance engineers to easily test designs between different secure environments. I researched current in house tools and created a TCL Tinker GUI interface that was similar to the current in house offering at Mentor.</p>
